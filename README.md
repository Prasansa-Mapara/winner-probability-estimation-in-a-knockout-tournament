# winner-probability-estimation-in-a-knockout-tournament
We wrote a C++ code on finding the probability of a team/player winning in a tournament, conducted in a single-elimination knockout format, based on the previous record of participants/teams, using the concept of Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking, and submask enumeration. The aim of the project was to optimize the time taken. We substantially reduced the time complexity from O(N!/(2ˆ N)) to O(N*(3ˆ N))
